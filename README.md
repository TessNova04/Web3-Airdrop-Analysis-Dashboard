# Data Cleaning and Analysis of User Demographics
## Web3 Airdrop Distribution Analysis

### Project Overview

This project documents a comprehensive data cleaning and standardization process on a raw dataset. The primary objective was to transform messy, inconsistent data into a structured and reliable format suitable for analysis and visualization.

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project is a simulated user dataset containing information on user demographics, transaction history, and engagement metrics. It was created for the purpose of demonstrating data cleaning and analysis techniques. The dataset is not publicly available.

### Tools

 - Data Cleaning -Excel
- Data Analysis(Pivot table) - Excel
- Visualization - Excel
- Documentation - GitHub

 ### Data Cleaning/ Preparation

 In the initial preparation phase, i performd the following tasks;
1. Data Loading and Assessment.
2. Problem Identification
3.Handling Missing/ Null Values.

### Questions Asked

#### User Demographics & Location

1.What is the breakdown of our user base by User Region?.

2.How do the different User Types contribute to our overall user count?.

3.How does the User Status vary across the different User Category types?.

#### Lead & Transaction Analysis

1.What is the distribution of Lead Score categories?.

2.What is the total Transaction Count for each Deal Size?.

3.How does the User Status correlate with Transaction Count?.

#### Campaign & Regional Performance

1.What is the distribution of Lead Score within the User Region of Europe?.

2.What is the total Transaction Count for each Lead Score?.

3.How does the Transaction Count for active users compare across the top 5 User Regions?.


### Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows;

1.The analysis provided a clear breakdown of the user base by region, user type, and status, which is essential for understanding the composition of the audience. The data revealed the proportion of Active versus Inactive users, a key metric for engagement.

2.The analysis of transaction counts and lead scores helped to evaluate user engagement and transaction trends. 

3.The analysis enabled a detailed breakdown of user behavior by region. This allows for a deeper understanding of geographic specific performance and helps in tailoring marketing campaigns to different locations.

4.The pivot table analysis provided valuable insights into voter demographics, including the total vote count for each political party, a breakdown of votes by gender and age range, and voter distribution by state.

### Results

I successfully transformed a raw dataset into a reliable source of truth by addressing several data quality issues:

-Inconsistent Data: I corrected messy string data and variations in capitalization, ensuring that similar entries were treated uniformly.

-Data Type Integrity: I converted colums to the correct data types, allowing for accurate calculations and reliable analysis.

-Completeness: During the cleaning process,i handled missing values, ensuring that the final dataset was more complete and trustworthy.

-New Insights: I added new features, such as Loyalty Rank and Phasing, which were created to enrich the dataset and enable deeper analysis beyond the raw data.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, i recommended the following;

-Focus resources on High Impact leads, as the data shows they generate the most transactions.
-Tailor campaign messaging and resource allocation to specific demographics and high turnout regions.
-Focus on converting Inactive users to Active ones to drive higher transaction counts.
